        <p>Hello there, my name is Jake. After a rewarding decade long career in manufacturing 
            I've decided to learn to code.</br>I've always enjoyed technology, as well as working 
            with my hands, so CNC programming led me to C# programming.

        Software Developer || Machinist</br>
        A little work history: I've spent ten years working in machine shops. For the most part, I've<br>
        worked as a lead machinist at Alabama Copper and Bronze, learning to operate every machine and<br>
        piece of equipment available to me. This includes lathes (including Verticle Turret Lathes), milling<br>
        machines, boring mills, threading machines, overhead cranes, exc. I am a certified forklift operator.<br>
        I left there for awhile while I was working on my degree to go learn about Computer Numeric<br>
        Controlled machining. This is a high end, fast paced process to make extremly precise parts using<br>
        CAD/CAM and GCode, a programming language using numbers. I started to work at Zorn Molds, which<br>
        I had worked at part time in the afternoon until they offered me a full time position. I learned alot<br>
        at Zorn about making high quality parts for molding machines. I also learned KANBAN systems, as<br>
        well as some experience in woodworking and 3D printing. From there I was offered an apprenticeship<br>
        at MetrologySouth, a company that works in the automotive and aerospace industry. I got to learn about<br>
        about Computer Aided Design and programming on multi-axis machines. I also got experience in<br>
        in welding and fabricating while I was there. I was eventually offer a job back at ACB to learn under<br>
        the shop supervisor, so I went back. All in all, its been a very rewarding career.<br>
        <br>
        I got into computer programming initially from learning GCode, then I wanted to learn how<br>
        to set up ERP systems for shops. This led me to TrueCoders and C#, which is my primary language.<br>
