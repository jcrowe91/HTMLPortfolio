        <h4>Software Developer || Machinist</h4>        
        Hello there, my name is Jake. After a rewarding decade-long career in manufacturing, I've decided to learn to code.<br>
I've always enjoyed technology, as well as working with my hands, so CNC programming led me to C# programming.
        </p>        
        <h2 style=font-size:large>A Little Work History:</h2> 
        <p1>I've spent ten years working in machine shops. For the most part, I've
worked as a lead machinist at Alabama Copper and Bronze, learning to operate every machine and
piece of equipment available to me. This includes lathes (including Verticle Turret Lathes), milling
machines, boring mills, threading machines, overhead cranes, etc. I am a certified forklift operator.
I left there for a while while I was working on my degree to go learn about Computer Numeric
Controlled machining. This is a high end, fast-paced process to make extremely precise parts using
CAD/CAM and GCode, a programming language using numbers. I started to work at Zorn Molds, which
I had worked part-time in the afternoon until they offered me a full-time position. I learned a lot
at Zorn about making high-quality parts for molding machines. I also learned KANBAN systems, as
well as some experience in woodworking and 3D printing. From there I was offered an apprenticeship
at MetrologySouth, a company that works in the automotive and aerospace industry. I got to learn about
Computer-Aided Design and programming on multi-axis machines. I also got experience in
welding and fabricating while I was there. I was eventually offered a job back at ACB to learn under
the shop supervisor, so I went back. All in all, it's been a very rewarding career.</p1>

I got into computer programming initially from learning GCode, then I wanted to learn how
to set up ERP systems for shops. This led me to TrueCoders and C#, which is my primary language.
